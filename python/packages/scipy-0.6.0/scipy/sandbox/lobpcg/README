Pure SciPy implementation of Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate
Gradient Method (LOBPCG), see
http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~aknyazev/software/BLOPEX/

lobpcg.py code was written by Robert Cimrman. Many thanks belong to Andrew
Knyazev, the author of the algorithm, for lots of advice and support.

The algorithm of LOBPCG is described in detail in:
