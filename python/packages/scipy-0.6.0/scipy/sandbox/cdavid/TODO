Various things to do before submitting outside sandbox
    - there is no doc.
    - the handling of non contiguous arrays is not really 
    elegant, and the code is difficult to maintain
    - rank > 2: must code in C ? (yuk)
    - for correlation: no reason to support only autocorrelation. Also, it is
stupid to offer difference function for different implementation: should be an
argument (fft vs no fft). Basically, the current API is not good.
