Routines for Gaussian Mixture Models and learning with Expectation Maximization 
===============================================================================

This module contains classes and function to compute multivariate Gaussian
densities (diagonal and full covariance matrices), Gaussian mixtures, Gaussian
mixtures models and an Em trainer.

More specifically, the module defines the following classes, functions:

- densities.gauss_den: function to compute multivariate Gaussian pdf 
- gauss_mix.GM: defines the GM (Gaussian Mixture) class. A Gaussian Mixture can
  be created from its parameters weights, mean and variances, or from its meta
  parameters d (dimension of the Gaussian) and k (number of components in the
  mixture). A Gaussian Model can then be sampled or plot (if d>1, plot
  confidence ellipsoids projected on 2 chosen dimensions, if d == 1, plot the
  pdf of each component and fill the zone of confidence for a given level)
- gmm_em.GMM: defines a class GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model). This class is
  constructed from a GM model gm, and can be used to train gm. The GMM can be
  initiated by kmean or at random, and can compute sufficient statistics, and
  update its parameters from the sufficient statistics.
- kmean.kmean: implements a kmean algorithm. We cannot use scipy.cluster.vq
  kmeans, since its does not give membership of observations.

Example of use: 
---------------

>>> #++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
>>> # Create an artificial 2 dimension, 3 clusters GM model, samples it
>>> #++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
>>> w, mu, va   = GM.gen_param(2, 3, 'diag', spread = 1.5)
>>> gm          = GM.fromvalues(w, mu, va)
>>> 
>>> # Sample 1000 frames  from the model
>>> data    = gm.sample(1000)
>>> 
>>> #++++++++++++++++++++++++
>>> # Learn the model with EM
>>> #++++++++++++++++++++++++
>>> # Init the model
>>> lgm = GM(d, k, mode)
>>> gmm = GMM(lgm, 'kmean')
>>> 
>>> # The actual EM, with likelihood computation. The threshold
>>> # is compared to the (linearly appromixated) derivative of the likelihood
>>> em      = EM()
>>> like    = em.train(data, gmm, maxiter = 30, thresh = 1e-8)

Files example.py and example2.py show more capabilities of the toolbox, including
plotting capabilities (using matplotlib) and model selection using Bayesian 
Information Criterion (BIC).
