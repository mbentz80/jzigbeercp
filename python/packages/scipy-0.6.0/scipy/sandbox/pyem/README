pyem is a python module build upon numpy and scipy
(see http://www.scipy.org/) for learning mixtures models
using Expectation Maximization. For now, only Gaussian
Mixture Models are implemented. Included features:
    
 * computation of Gaussian pdf for multi-variate Gaussian
 random vectors (spherical, diagonal and full covariance matrices)
 * Sampling of Gaussian Mixtures Models
 * Confidence ellipsoides with probability at arbitrary level
 * Classic EM for Gaussian Mixture Models
 * K-mean based and random initialization for EM available
